<h1><u>My Favorite Travel Destinations</u></h1>      

<li><h2>Kokrobite Beach</h2></li>
<p>The place is yet another beach that will catch your attention when you are in Ghana. The place is just 30 KM away from Accra so people can actually club the journey. The Academy of African Music and Art present in this location pulls in a lot of people who are interested in the creative side of human lives. One can book the resorts which provide a beautiful view of the beach. Or else they can also visit it for a day trip where they enjoy the beautiful sunny beach. The ‘Homowo’ festival held in the month of May is also a popular time when tourists flock to this beach.</p>

    <li><h2>Kakum National Park</h2></li>
    <p>Ghana is a biodiverse place which has some unique species of plants and animals and certainly one of the most beautiful regions in Ghana. Kakum national park is a place that one needs to go for visiting the rainforests of Ghana. It is stretched over an extensive part of southern Ghana. One can see buffalos, meerkats, civets, elephants and several species of birds when they are at this place. The Canopy Walkway is a key part of the national park and pulls a lot of tourists. People should definitely take guided tours to have a complete idea of the place.
